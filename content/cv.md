## Skills

#### Programming Languages
**C & C++** - C++ is the language I have used most.  
**PHP** – Short experience with PHP, mentioned later in “LAMP Stack”.  
**C#, Python** – I used C# exclusively in an ASP .NET web framework setting, and Python mostly for
the Flask and Django web frameworks.  
**Javascript** – Used for FreeCodeCamp certifications.  
**HTML, CSS** – Also for FreeCodeCamp.

#### Software
**Visual Studio** – In the past I used Visual Studio, but more recently I’ve mostly used VS Code. 
**Linux** – I spent a significant amount of time using Linux as my main OS before deciding to dual boot
and only use Linux for programming. At this point in time I use Windows exclusively.  
**CMake** – CMake is an essential part of open source, and thus I learned to use it and integrated it in
some of my own projects.  
**Git** – Even more widespread than CMake in open source and industry.  
**Unity** – Some small games.

#### LAMP Stack
I have experience with Linux. Tying Apache, MySQL and PHP together resembles previous
experiences with web frameworks (e.g. Flask-SQLAlchemy). With the LAMP stack I created a demo
website with user registration, login, user-visible pages, and an admin page to manage users.

This site was created with Pelican, a Python static site generator.

#### Language

Intermediate-low level of Japanese proficiency.
