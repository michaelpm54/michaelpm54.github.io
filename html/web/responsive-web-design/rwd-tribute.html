                Dr Borlaug received an honorary doctorate by the Agricultural University of Norway for his work on improving wheat yields, particularly in developing countries. He is said to have saved the lives of a billion people. <br /><br /> Norman
                Borlaug was born in 1914 to Henry Oliver and Clara Borlaug on his grandfather's farm in Iowa, USA. In 1933 he decided to leave the farm in pursuit of a life of learning. <br /><br /> From 1942 to 1944 Dr Borlaug worked as a microbiologist,
                then in late 1944 he joined the wheat research team at the Mexican Ministry of Agriculture, where he stayed for 16 years. It was during this time that he developed high-yield, disease-resistant, semi-dwarf wheat that would lead to dramatically
                increased wheat yields and a reduction in starvation in Asia and Africa. <br /><br /> Borlaug died of lymphoma at the age of 95, on September 12, 2009, in his Dallas home.
